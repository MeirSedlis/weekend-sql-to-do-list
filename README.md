# Weekend SQL To Do List: Task Tracker

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Description

This to do list app was built over the course of three days. It was my third solo project for the Prime Digital Academy Full Stack training program, and my first time using PostgreSQL and Bootstrap.

If there's a to-do list app out there, I've probably tried it. 

Getting organized can sometimes be a struggle for me, and so I've made it a priority. When we got this assignment, I was excited to create a motivational app that could help prioritize and display tasks in a meaningful way.

My app is successful in the following ways:

- When a user enters a task, there are multiple checks to prevent SQL injection and ensure data entering the table can be used effectively when returned to the app.
- The task.importance field offers the user an additional layer of customization to help prioritize tasks. 
    - high importance tasks are bolded
    - moderate importance tasks are italicized
- The random background generator shuffles through a selection of calm, uplifting photos on page load and when the "Get Inspiration" button is clicked.
- The bootstrap styling is clear, easy to read, and visually appealing.
